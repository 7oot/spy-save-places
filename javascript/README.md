# Find safe places in JavaScript

### Getting started

- cd into project directory
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run tests:
  - run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
  - run tests once: `npm test`

# Find safe places in Ruby

### Requirements

For this exercise we will be using Javascript and nodejs. For running the tests we need Jest. To install Jest just install the dependencies from the bundle using 'bundle install'.

To run the test, type in: `npm test` or for watch mode `npm run test:watch`

### Creating the solution

All things are located in the file run.rb.

There are two files for this challenge. One file holds the methods, you have to implement to solve the challenge. It is located in `./src/savePlaces.js`.

The other file is holding the tests, with all requirements for this challenge. You can find them in the feil `./test/savePlaces.test.js`.

For each function in the savePlaces.js there is a suite of Jest-tests with example input and exprected results from the function in savePlaces.test.js.

__By defaults the tests are disabled. Please enable the tests, by replacing the 'xdescribe' with 'describe'__

### Running tests

To run the test:

```
npm test
```
