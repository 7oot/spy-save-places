# Code Challenge: Find save places

We prepared repositories with test-suites for different coding languages. In order to solve the challenge, pick one of the favorite language and write the functions, so that all tests in the test-suites get green.

Before you begin, create a branch for your solution.

Then submit your solution as a Pull Request into the repository.
